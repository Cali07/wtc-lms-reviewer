# Review System 2.0 🚀

Welcome to **Review System 2.0**! This project was born out of a simple necessity: to streamline the cumbersome and time-consuming review process. As someone who often felt overwhelmed by the traditional methods of handling reviews, I decided to take matters into my own hands. 🌟

## 📖 My Story

Honestly, when I started this project, I was tired of the traditional review processes. The need to remember multiple UUIDs, the slow pace, and the sometimes redundant steps made it all feel overwhelming. I wanted to create a system that not only made the review process quicker but also encouraged face-to-face interaction and learning. 

After learning Bash scripting, I developed **Review System 2.0** as a way to automate the mundane parts of the process while still keeping the essence of thorough reviews. This tool is a reflection of my journey in finding a balance between efficiency and quality in reviews.
